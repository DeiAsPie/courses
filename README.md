# Welcome to Courses

This repository is intended to contain the courses that would provide quality, yet, free educational resources to individuals as well the code that generates the website presenting it to them. The main priority being the actual content being recommended.

# Help! however you like.

Without the support of the community this idea and intention would not breathe life. Suggest courses to be added, open issues, participate in discussions or even give a PR.
